.TH BASE 1 "June 2013" "base 1.0.2" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
base \- base directory environment
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B base
.RI [ label ]
.PP
.B bcd
.RI [ path ]
.br
.B base_deactivate
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B base
creates an environment with a base directory.  Execute \fBbase\fR from the
base directory using "." at the beginning, so that it is executed within your
current environment, as follows:
.PP
	\fB. base\fR [\fIlabel\fR]
.PP
If you do not use the "." then the command will have no (lasting) effect.  The
\fBlabel\fR can be used to identify the environment.  If you do not specify
one, then the name of the base directory is used.
.PP
The prompt and title of the terminal change according to what directory you
are in.  When within the base directory, the label in brackets and the current
path within the base directory are displayed.  For example, when in the
\fIsrc\fR directory under a base environment labelled "app", the prompt would
be displayed as follows:
.PP
	[app] /src$
.PP
When outside the base directory, the label in parenthesis and the current path
are displayed.  For example, when in the \fI/etc\fR directory outside of a
base environment labelled "app", the prompt would be displayed as follows:
.PP
	(app) /etc$
.PP
.B base
adds two functions to your environment: \fBbcd\fR and \fBbase_deactivate\fR.
.PP
The \fBbcd\fR function changes to directories relative to the base directory.
Similar to how the \fBcd\fR command changes to your HOME directory when no
arguments are given, \fBbcd\fR changes to your base directory when no
arguments are given.  Use the tab key to use auto-completion relative to the
base directory.
.PP
The \fBbase_deactivate\fR function removes the effects of this script and
restores previous settings.  Note that nested base environments are not
supported.
.PP
Scripts named \fB.base.activate.sh\fR and \fB.base.deactivate.sh\fR in the
base directory are sourced automatically when base is activated/deactivated,
if they exist.
