## Timeline

Base has a long history.  I have used it almost every day for over fourteen
years!

* 2007 - Base started out as a simple `${HOME}/bin` script and was gradually
  improved on over the years.
* 2011 - I first released Base as open source in my company GitHub account.
  Note that the commit history is still available in the `main` branch.
* 2014 - I stopped maintenance of Base when I became busy with a new job.
  Note that I still *used* Base every day at the new job.
* 2018 - I removed my terminated company accounts, and the Base repository
  went offline.  I planned on releasing a second major version using a
  different GitHub account soon after, but I was unable to allot the time
  required to get it done.
* 2021 - I completed the rewrite and finally released the second major
  version.
